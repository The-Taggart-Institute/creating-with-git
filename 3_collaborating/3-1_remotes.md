# 3-1: Remotes

This whole time, we've been pretending to be working with a team on different features and branches in our project. But in reality, doing so means coordinating respositories across multiple computers. And while we haven't yet done so with our exploration of Git, this was absolutely its design intention. This where **remotes** come in.

## Remotes

All the way back at the beginning of the course, I asked you to **fork** this repo on GitHub and then **clone** your copy of the repo. And then we never mentioned those two operations again. Now I'd like you to navigate to that folder on your computer in your terminal, and run the following command:

```bash
cat .git/config
```

Now head over to our `gitdemo` repo that we've been working on this whole time. Run the same command. See any differences?

The cloned repo has several sections not present in `gitdemo`. For starters, a `[remote "origin"]` that seems to indicate where the repo came from in the first place. 

**Remotes** are copies of the repository on another computer. Often, this is on a Git hosting service like GitHub (there are others, btw). Git will connect to this remote copy of the repo and **pull** new changes present there but missing locally, and **push** new changes that are local but yet to be sent to the remote. 

When working with a team, usually a single remote is defined as the **single source of truth** for a project, and commits to the remote's `main` branch are carefully managed. Different hosting services offer different mechanisms for reviewing and approving changes, which we'll talk about shortly.

But first, we need to discuss a little more about how remotes work with our local repo. To make this clearer, run `git branch -a` in your fork of this course repo.

The `-a` option shows all branches, not just locals. With this option, you see `remotes/origin` entries as well. `origin` is Git's name for the default remote, and is assigned to a source repo when we `clone` it.

You can have more than one remote, for example a backup, or an upstream version of the project. But most repos hosted remotely have just the one.

## Git Hosts

Speaking of hosts, while GitHub is by far the most well-known, there are several other choices for Git Hosting! Here are few to check out:

* [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
* [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)
* [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org)
* Or self-host with [Gitea](https://gitea.io)!

## Remotes In Action

We've seen `git clone` do its thing, but there's actually quite a bit going on under the hood. To demonstrate, we're going to add a remote to `gitdemo` manually. To do this, you'll need a GitHub account, but you already have one of those!

While logged in, head to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new). We're making a new repo on GitHub. Call it `gitdemo`. You can make it private if you like. Don't bother adding a `README` or anything else. Your options should look something like this:

Create that thing! GitHub will then helpfully give you some pointers on how to connect a local repo to it. But don't jump ahead; we're doing it step-by-step.

### Step 1: Add a Remote

Get your Terminal into the `gitdemo` folder. Here's where we add a remote manually.

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/gitdemo.git
```

We've already created a `main` branch, so we're all set there.

If you `cat .git/config` now, you'll see a remote set up!

### Step 2: Connect Local `main` to `origin/main`

Right now, Git doesn't know that your local `main` has anything to do with `main` on GitHub. Well in fact, right now GitHub's `main` doesn't exist. Let's fix that. 

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

And there's `git push`! This does 2 things: it creates a `main` branch on GitHub by uploading our local commits; and it sets up our local `main` to track the new `main` on GitHub. You can confirm this by examining `.git/config`. There's now a new `[branch "main"]` section that points to `origin` as its remote.

Now that we have a remote, let's demonstrate merging changes from it to our local copyâ€”also known as a `pull`.

## Making Remote Changes

Luckily, GitHub is making a very helpful suggestion for us in terms of remote changes: adding a `README`!

![Add a README](/img/git-remotes-2.png)

Let's do it! Click that button. You'll be taken to GitHub's built-in editor for our new file. It's fine as-is; just hit that big green "Commit changes..." button.

![Commit Changes](/img/git-remotes-3.png)

And click through again for the default commit message.

Hey, now there's a `README.md` on the GitHub version of `main`. But our local is missing it.

## Fetching Remote Changes

You might be thinking the solution is `git pull`, and you're right, but slow down! `git pull`, much like `git clone`, is actually multiple Git commands disguised in a trenchcoat.

First, let's run `git status` to see how things stand.

![Git Remotes 4](/img/git-remotes-4.png)

Now that we have a remote, `git status` provides new information. But _we know it's wrong!_ Our branch is not up to date with GitHub! What's up?

This is important: **Git does not fetch remote changes automatically**. But we can. Do so with `git fetch.` Now run `git status` again.


![Git Remotes 5](/img/git-remotes-5.png)

Aha! Now it knows.

While it tells us we can run `git pull`, here's a secret: `git pull` is `git fetch` + `git merge <remote branch>`. 

So at this point, if you run `git merge origin/main`, you'll perform exactly what `git pull` would have done.

![Git Remotes 6](/img/git-remotes-6.png)

Nobody actually does this; `git pull` is way more convenient. But I wanted you to understand what was happening underneath. Because Git maintains a local copy of the remote branch, it's available for merging after a fetch. Pulling is just a combination of those two operations. 

Okay, that'll do it for remotes. Up next, we'll talk about how to handle multiple remote branches and merging changes to `main`.

## Check For Understanding

**If `pull` is a combination of `fetch` and `merge`, what happens on the remote during `git push`?**
