# 5-1: Exhibition of Mastery

It's time to take what you've practiced here and prove you understand it. Luckily, this course's EoM is about as straightforward as possible. Your mission, should you choose to accept it:

**Take this repo and reshape it to your purposes. Use the Honkit structure to produce documentation for anything you like: a hobby, a process at workâ€”heck, it could even be a family cookbook. But use Git to make and track changes, maintain branches, and publish the result as a searchable website. Then, share your results with us on [The Taggart Institute Commons](https://discord.gg/thetaggartinstitute)!**

## Thank You!

I hope you've enjoyed this course. Thank you for your time, attention, and hard work. Well done on making it all the way through.
