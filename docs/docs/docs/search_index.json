With Git\n\nThis repository and book serves as the instructional material and work template for the course \"Creating With Git\" on The Taggart Institute.\nSetup\nGitHub Account and SSH Key\nFor our work in this course, you'll need a GitHub account. Sign up for one if you don't have one; it's free!\n\nIf you have an objection to using GitHub for one reason or another, that's fine. If you know enough to have reasons to not like GitHub, you probably know enough to modify the instructions to use a Git host you prefer.\n\nTo best use GitHub the way we intend, we need to connect an SSH key to it. This will serve as our authenticaiton method to GitHub in the terminal.\nIf you know what an SSH key is and have one already, you can skip this part. For everyone else, let's check if you do have one. In your terminal (on Linux and macOS), run the following command:\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nFor Windows PowerShell users, you can run:\ncat ~/_ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nIf you get output, that's your SSH public key! That's what we'll need for the next step. If you didn't get anything, then for all operating systems, you're running:\nssh-keygen\n\nFor now you can just breeze through the process. Add a passphrase if you like, but make sure you remember it! Then run the appropriate cat command above to get the public key available for some copypasta.\nNow, navigate to https://github.com/settings/keys and click \"New SSH key.\"\n\nName it whatever you like. I tend to name it after the computer I generated it on. Copy and paste the public key from the terminal into the \"Key\" text area and make sure the \"Key type\" remains \"Authentication Key.\"\nClick \"Add SSH key,\" and your account is all set to work correctly!\nGet This Repo\nAs this is an instructional repo on the use of Git, we'll be forking, then cloning this repo to use it.\nHead over to, well, this. https://github.com/The-Taggart-Institute/creating-with-git. \nFork the repo to your account with this button: \n\nWith your very own copy of the repo, clone it down by copying the URL and then heading over to your terminal and typing:\ngit clone git@github.com:your-github-account/creating-with-git.git\n\nIf you added a passphrase to your SSH key, you'll be prompted for it. Type it in and press Enter, although you won't see any visual confirmation of keystrokes.\nWe'll learn more about what clone actually means later, but for now, hey! You have your very own copy of this repo. Get in there.\ncd creating-with-git\n\nInstall Requirements\nThis project uses honkit, which is a Node package. That means we need to have Node/NPM installed. head over to NodeJS for details on installing Node/NPM for your platform. The LTS version will do fine. Once it's all installed, run the following in our repo:\nnpm i --dev\n\nThis'll install everything we need to run Honkit. You can give it a try by running the following command:\nnpx honkit serve\nThat should launch local web server that serves up the website version of this repo on http://localhost:4000. Check it out!\nUsage\nAs you go through the course, use the material here as supplemental reading, as well as a starting point for your own documentation. At several points, you'll find parts that you'll be asked to fill in to complete your very own resource for Git documentation! As you do, make commits with your own changes, and consider publishing them for yourself!\n"},"1_gitting-acquainted/":{"url":"1_gitting-acquainted/","title":"1: Gitting Acquainted","keywords":"","body":"1: Gitting Acquainted\nThis section is all about the basics of Git.\n"},"1_gitting-acquainted/1-1_the-project.html":{"url":"1_gitting-acquainted/1-1_the-project.html","title":"1-1: The Project","keywords":"","body":"1-1: The Project\nI know you're here to learn about Git, so you might have expected a whole folder worth of code—Python maybe, or JavaScript. But all you'll find in here is text in Markdown files. That's because Git is about much more than just code. It's a way to manage any project based around files that changes over time. It's a way to manage those changes, explore possibile alternate versions, and easily collaborate with your team.\nThere's nothing about Git that is necessarily specific to programming projects. Anything that is mostly about text can be managed with Git. So we're going to make ourselves a book—a book that can be published as a PDF, an eBook, or a website. This book will be about Git itself, but yours can be about whatever you like. \nEvery organization, every team...heck, every person, struggles with documenting their processes and procedures. The bigger the organization, the bigger the struggle. That's why a method of easily producing and maintaining documentation is so valuable. Learning Git (and Markdown, while we're at it) will empower you to produce documentation you know can be maintained for years.\nGoals\nWhen considering a documentation platform, we need it to be:\n\nEasy to update\nEasy to read\nEasy to search\n\nHonkit and Markdown fit the bill here. \nWhy Markdown? Why Honkit?\nWith a project structure built entirely on plaintext files, we don't need to worry about losing the data to some proprietary platform that someday we'll need to migrate from. Text is not beholden to licensing. Even if someday Honkit stops working, the site/book you make with the code will continue to function, and using the text files with any other generating tool will be simple.\nProject management products have come and gone. You know what has stood the test of time? HTML. That's why I'm putting my documentation in it.\nLearning Markdown\nReading this documentation's source will give you a solid overview of Markdown syntax. Honkit will handle the conversion to HTML. If you want to learn more about Markdown syntax, check out Commonmark.\nCheck For Understanding\nUsing Markdown, create a list of goals for your own set of documentation. It can be about absolutely anything. Honestly if I weren't trying to sound professional, I'd probably make this whole thing about the evolution of Star Trek starship design.

But what is a Git repo?\nSimply, it's a folder with a hidden .git folder inside of it that manages versions and changes of the contents.\nMore nerdily, it's a folder turned into a TARDIS: it contains more than it looks like, and it can travel in time and between possible realities.\n\nCreating Git Repos\nLet's start from the assumption that you have Git installed. On the command line, run git --version to make sure.\nWhile we're at it, let's configure Git for our usage. We need to tell Git who we are, so our changes (commits) can be labeled. We do so by providing a username and an email address.\ngit config --global user.name=username\ngit config --global user.email=user@domain.com\n\nThe username and email don't have to match your GitHub account, but it's not a bad idea. \nWith that out of the way, let's make a new folder outside of this repository. We'll use this folder as a sort of laboratory for Git experiments. Then we can take what we've learned and apply it to the Checks for Understanding in this repo.\nmkdir gitdemo\ncd gitdemo\ngit init -b main\n\nNote: The -b main isn't strictly necessary, but we do it to make the name of our default branch \"main\" instead of the built-in \"master.\" Lots of folks are uncomfortable with that language, and it's easy to fix.\ngit init initializes a Git repo in the current folders. It won't seem like much occurred after you run this command, but just under the surface, quite a bit has taken place. Run ls -al and you'll see a hidden .git folder. Listing those contents will result in something like this:\ntotal 40\ndrwxrwxr-x 7 user user 4096 Feb 26 15:03 .\ndrwxrwxr-x 3 user user 4096 Feb 26 15:03 ..\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 user user 4096 Feb 26 15:03 branches\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user   92 Feb 26 15:03 config\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user   73 Feb 26 15:03 description\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user   21 Feb 26 15:03 HEAD\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 user user 4096 Feb 26 15:03 hooks\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 user user 4096 Feb 26 15:03 info\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 user user 4096 Feb 26 15:03 objects\ndrwxrwxr-x 4 user user 4096 Feb 26 15:03 refs\nYou're looking at what makes a Git repo a Git repo. You do not have to understand what each file and directory in .git does, but it helps to understand that this folder contains the Git magic. In fact, if you deleted all the files in a repo except for the .git folder, you'd still be able to reconstruct the files from the last commit!\nBefore we move on to make our first commit, let's quickly look at the contents of the .git/config file.\n[core]\n    repositoryformatversion = 0\n    filemode = true\n    bare = false\n    logallrefupdates = true\nNow for comparison, check this repo's .git/config file. You may be able to see why this file is so important.\nLet's move on to the basic workflow in Git, or the \"core loop.\"\n"},"1_gitting-acquainted/1-3_git-core-loop.html":{"url":"1_gitting-acquainted/1-3_git-core-loop.html","title":"1-3: The Git Core Loop","keywords":"","body":"The Git Core Loop\nLet's define it right up top:\n\nCreate\nStage\nCommit\n\nWhen working on a project in a Git repository, we begin by creating the content we want. This could be new files or edits to existing files—even deletions of files. Once creation is finished for a specific goal, like a new feature, chapter, or a bugfix, we stage the changes—selecting what will be included in this chapter of the project's history. Finally, we commit the changes to the timeline with a message to the future about whatever it was we did in this set of changes.\nA Useful Metaphor\nI like to use the space shuttle as a metaphor for the steps of the Git Core Loop.\nCreate: The VAB\n\nThe Vehicle Assembly Building is where the components of a shuttle launch were combined: liquid fuel tank, solid rocket boosters, and the shuttle itself.\n\nThis is equivalent to making the changes that are part of a commit.\nStage: The Crawler\nThe Mobile Launch Platform, colloquially known as \"The Crawler,\" moved the assembled shuttle from the VAB to the launchpad. This process took days—hopefully our commits won't!\n\nThis is where we stage our changes for commit, but don't yet enter them into history.\nLiftoff\n\nLet's light this candle! The shuttle's main engines and solid rocket boosters power it into low earth orbit. \nThis is where we commit our changes to history.\nI'll stop here before completely overextending this metaphor. Hopefully it's helpful. But now, let's actually do some work. \nOur First Commit\nLet's head on over to our gitdemo folder/repo to do some work.\nTo start, let's create a new file by outputting text via the terminal:\necho \"My first commit!\" > file1.txt\n\nAnd now, it's time for our first (and arguably most important) Git command:\ngit status\nYour output should look something like this:\n\n\nGit tells us what branch we're on (more on branches later).\nThis won't be here for long, but Git now tells us we haven't made any commits.\nWe do however have untracked files—files Git has no idea about.\nHere are those files.\n\nAs the command suggests, let's run git add file1.txt to add the file, and run git status again.\n\nNow Git tells us we have changes \"to be committed.\" Put another, we have staged changes. Put yet another way, we have rolled the shuttle out to the launchpad.\nWe are go for launch. Run git commit and don't freak out at what happens.\n\nA text editor (whichever one is defined in the $EDITOR environment variable) pops up. For me, it's Vim. For you, it may be Nano. This is the long-form way of writing commit messages, where we briefly describe what we did. In this case, we might consider a simple note like \"Add file1.txt\". Write that message, and then save/quit from the editor.\nThen, run git status one more time.\n\nWe have made history! It might not seem momentous, but the timeline of our repo has begun. Run git log to see it in all its glory.\ncommit 0581a2b2cb2ec73d92809e25457d6ae5fd6d3060 (HEAD -> main)\nAuthor: Michael Taggart \nDate:   Mon Feb 27 00:01:19 2023 -0800\n\n    Add file1.txt\n\nNow, your log won't look exactly like this one, but it will have the same parts. In order:\n\nA unique commit hash and a reference that links the commit to a branch, and marks it as the most recent commit (HEAD)\nAuthor information\nA timestamp\nThe commit message\n\nThere are other ways to view the log and we'll explore them soon. For now, just know that this is how we can see exactly what has taken place in our project's history.\nOur Second Commit\nThe first commit is cool, but the second commit? That's when the good stuff happens. Let's make another change.\necho \"My second commit!\" >> file1.txt\n\nLet's see that git status now.\n\nBefore we make our next commit, let's review the changes so far in detail. git diff, or git diff  will tell us exactly what's changed since the last commit. Try git diff file1.txt.\n\nGit is telling us a new line has been added since the last commit. Which, yeah, it has. This is obviously a very simple change, but I find it handy to use git diff to check just what's changed before I make the commit. That helps shape the commit message.\nLet's stage that change one more time with git add file1.txt.\nSpeaking of commit messages, let's try a slightly quicker method for this one. By passing the -m option and a message, we can avoid entering the text editor for the commit message.\ngit commit -m \"Add second line to file1\"\n\nNotice what Git tells us after this: \n[main d9e8f3e] Add second line to file1\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n\nThe \"insertion\" is Git recognizing that the file has changed by way of addition.\nViewing Histoy\nWith two commits under our belt, let's view our history so far with git log.\n\nYou're probably wondering about that glob of letters and numbers.\nWhen Git makes a commit, it takes the content, adds a special header, and creates a SHA-1 hash. This hash becomes the \"id\" of the commit. We'll use these more later; what's important now is that they are unique to each commit.\nEach commit has author information (remember those git config --global commands?), as well as a timestamp and, of course, the commit message.\nYou can see an abbreviated version of the log with git log --oneline.\nNow that we're familiar with the Git Core Loop, in the next lesson we'll review some best practices for commits.\nCheck For Understanding\nIn your own words, describe the Git Core Loop.\n"},"1_gitting-acquainted/1-4_commit-best-practices.html":{"url":"1_gitting-acquainted/1-4_commit-best-practices.html","title":"1-4: Commit Best Practices","keywords":"","body":"1-4: Commit Best Practices\nAt first, it's tempting to think of commits like saving your work: do it frequently so that you never risk losing anything. I get that, but I urge you to resist that instinct.\nYour commit history is the story of your project. How do you want it to read? Personally, I would want clear events that tell the story of how the project evolved. Not every commit has to be an epic moment, but they should be, whenever possible, distinct accomplishments.\nRight now our gitdemo project is pretty small, so that can be difficult to simulate. Still, let's give it a go. Start by adding a second file.\necho \"This is the second file!1\" > file2.txt\ngit add file2.txt\ngit commit -m \"Add second file\"\n\nThat's not a typo in the first command. Well it is, but it's intentional. We've committed a mistake. Now our objective should be to fix it. Use whatever text editor you like to remove the 1 from the end of file2.txt.\nThe next step in our project's life is to fix the mistake. Bugfixes are important commits and should be isolated as much as possible. Don't lump them in with other changes—at some point you'll want to know when a fix was introduced, and it'll be much easier if it is by itself.\nFor this commit, we'll learn another shortcut. You can add/commit with one move by adding -a to git commit, like so:\ngit commit -am \"Fix file2 typo\"\n\nThis will add all unstaged changes at once, so be careful! Only use this when you know for sure that you want to commit every change you've made.\nWhat Makes a Good Commit Message?\nAlthough Git opens the full text editor for you, suggesting you write a short story about the commit, I don't think that's correct. A short sentence or phrase that begins with the action taken is appropriate. \"Add section on good commit messages\" might be a solid one for this section of the text. The reader quickly knows what changed and how.\nThere are other places to add more detail, some of which we'll discuss later. For now, there is a little-known Git feature to add more detail about a commit afterwards and separately: Notes.\nGit Notes\nGit Notes are note exactly a secret feature, but since GitHub doesn't show them, they might as well be. They allow additional context to commits. Think of them as accessories to commits—stored separately, but related.\nTo add a note, run git notes add. This will bring up the text editor, allowing you to write whatever you like.\nBy default, the note will be added to the most recent commit.\nRun git log to see how the note adds to the commit message.\nWanna makes changes to the current note? git notes edit will bring the editor back up!\nIf you want to add notes for another commit, use git notes add . \ngit notes remove works as you'd expect, and can also accept a commit ID.\nCheck For Understanding\nMakes some changes to your files, then commit the changes. Then, add a log to both the current commit and the previous commit!\n"},"1_gitting-acquainted/1-5_fixing-mistakes.html":{"url":"1_gitting-acquainted/1-5_fixing-mistakes.html","title":"1-5: Fixing Mistakes","keywords":"","body":"1-5: Fixing Mistakes, Pt. 1\nSo far our commits have been nice a linear, with no mistakes. But a quick look at GitHub Commits will tell you that's not always the case.\nSo let's get into some trouble and learn how to get out of it. We'll begin by creating a file and committing it, even though we don't actually want it. \necho \"I shouldn't be here!\" > mistake.txt\ngit add mistake.txt\ngit commit -m \"Add a mistake\"\n\nRemoving Files\nSo of course this is a bit contrived, but it's not uncommon to decide we no longer want a file in our repo. If we simply rm the file, Git will notice the file's gone, but you'll still awkwardly have to git add the now-missing file.\nIt's more appropriate in these situations to git rm , which is what we'll do now. This will delete the file and stage the deletion for commit.\ngit rm mistake.txt\n\nNotice that git status now shows a deleted event staged. Commit this change.\ngit commit -m \"Remove mistake.txt\"\n\nThere is also a git mv that will rename files and automatically stage the changes. In truth I often forget this one. Git is pretty good and recognizing renames/moves, which I add with git add.\nOkay but what happens if we remove a file with rm and want it back?\nrm file1.txt\n\n\"Taggart, you fool!\" I hear you say. \"We needed that file!\"\nNo worries, friendo. Git knows about the file and has its contents in the depths of its archives. Because we didn't git rm it from the working tree, we can do the following:\ngit restore file1.txt\n\nEt voilà. It's back! Git saves us from ourselves.\nGoing Back in Time\nSince Git obviously stores files in its database, you might imagine it's possible to go back in time to prior states—and you'd be right. That's what git reset is for. \nThere's kind of a lot to git reset, and we'll be coming back to it. For now, let's make a single commit that we come to regret.\necho \"I wish I hadn't done this\" >> file1.txt\ngit commit -am \"I'll come to regret this\"\n\nWelp. Here we are. Maybe we don't exactly regret this commit, but it was incomplete. We had more to do before actually committing this. We can pull this commit back (as long as we haven't sent it anywhere) and rework it. To do so, we run git reset . The commit is a commit hash we want to revert to. All changes after that commit will then become unstaged stages. \nWe've seen the term HEAD in git log output already. This is where it comes in handy. HEAD represents the most recent commit—like the \"playhead\" on tape player. We can refer to the most reset commit with HEAD. But of course, we want to go back before the most recent commit. Luckily, we can add a ^ to increment the HEAD by one. So HEAD^ means the penultimate commit.\nWatch what happens when we reset to it.\ngit reset HEAD^\n\n\nLook at that! Unstaged changes. You can use git diff to confirm that it's our new line that's now unstaged. We're now free to change the file and recommit as we like.\ngit reset can take any commit hash as an argument. All changes since that commit will then become unstaged changes. So while we just went back 2 commits with HEAD^, we could have gone all the way back to the first commit in git log, and everything we've done since then would have been unstaged changes!\nGoing --hard\nOne last important note about git reset. Implicitly, we are passing the --soft argument to it, which is why any changes past our target commit become unstaged changes. If, however, you really want to go permanently back in time, you can use git reset --hard . This will revert your files to the state they were in at the time of that commit. No unstaged changes. Now you can rewrite the future.\nAmending Commits\nLet's add just a bit more to our repo.\necho \"Ah just kidding, I'm good with it\" >> file1.txt\ngit commit -am \"I feel good about this commit\"\n\nAh but wait; it turns out we wanted to add something to file2.txt as part of this commit! If we have more to add to an existing commit, we can use --amend with git commit to add our new changes to the last commit. Without any other options, this will pop open the text editor, but you can use -m to provide a message on the command line.\necho \"But wait! Don't leave me behind!\" >> file2.txt\ngit add file2.txt\ngit commit --amend -m \"I feel good about this commit\"\n\nThis will add the new changes to the previous commit with the same message. We could of course have altered the message as well if we wanted.\nCheck For Understanding\nMake some commits here, then reset them, reset them --hard, and maybe even try --amending some commits afterwards! Then when you're ready, I'll see you in Unit 2, where we explore alternate branches of reality.\n"},"2_possibilities/":{"url":"2_possibilities/","title":"2: Possibilities","keywords":"","body":"2: Possibilities\nThis Unit discusses the many ways to modify our repo, moving forward, back, and even sideways in time!\n"},"2_possibilities/2-1_branches.html":{"url":"2_possibilities/2-1_branches.html","title":"2-1: Branches","keywords":"","body":"2-1: Branches\n\nLet's make like Loki and break the timestream\nWe've explored moving forward and backward in time, but what about...sideways?\nYes, it's possible. With branches, we're able to explore alternate realities of our project while maintaining the integrity of the \"prime timeline.\" Then, if we're happy with the changes we've made in one of our alternate branches, we can bring them into the main branch. This process is known as merging.\nBranching Basics\nMultiple git subcommands are used when working with branches, so we'll take this slow. To begin, let's run git branch in our gitdemo repository.\nNot a lot to see, eh? We only have one branch right now: main. We'll soon change that.\nLet's imagine we want to play with some ideas for our project in a new file named experiment.txt. But rather than mussing our current branch with our experiment, we'll create a new branch to do our work.\nStrangely, the most common way to make a new branch is not with git branch. Instead, we use git checkout -b .\nWait, what?\nJust trust me for a minute. Let's run it now.\ngit checkout -b experiment\nNow, what does git branch show you?\n\nIf you're using our virtual machine or a Git-aware shell, your prompt will also change!\n\nWe are now in a different branch. Commits we make here will be isolated from the main branch. Let's prove it.\necho \"Let's see what this does!\" > experiment.txt\ngit add experiment.txt\ngit commit -m \"Add experiment.txt\"\nOkay so we have a new commit. You can confirm it's there with git log if you like, but it's there. And our working tree is clean, with no unstaged changes. That means we're free to checkout to another branch. Let's go back to main.\ngit checkout main\ngit branch confirms we're in the right spot. And ls will show that...hey wait! Where's experiment.txt?\nIt's in another branch at the moment. Check git log.\nIt's like our experiment never happened! Use git checkout - to switch back to the previous branch. The - works kind of like the \"Back\" button on a television remote.\nRunning ls shows our experiment.txt is back, and git log once again shows our commit. We're in an alternate timeline! \nChecking Out git checkout\nThe --help page for git checkout has a definition that is, well, utterly unhelpful.\n\nUpdates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. If no pathspec was given, git checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the current branch.\n\nThanks, makes perfect sense. Well, it would if you knew all of those Git internals, but this is an intro course and you shouldn't have to. So what does git checkout really do?\nGiven a branch or a commit hash, git checkout will update the repo to match the state at that commit. That might sound like git reset, but there's a very important difference: git checkout will not treat changes after a given commit (or in another branch) as though they exist.\nRun git log and choose a commit hash, any commit hash. Then use it with git checkout. \nFirst, you get a rather wordy message from Git. You'll notice that all changes after your target commit are just...gone. Not unstaged. \nOh no; did we just destroy the future?\nNah, read that message.\nThe important term here is the detached HEAD. You've essentially entered a safe bubble (or Mirror Universe, for Doctor Strange fans) that has no impact on any branch's real timeline. It's pretty odd, and I almost never do this, but it is possible. The important point here is that your future changes are treated as nonexistent here in this bubble universe. But don't worry; it's easy to get out. As the message tells you, git switch - will work just fine, but so will git checkout -. After doing exactly that, we're back in the present of the experiment branch, with all our work intact. \nNow to switch back to main, we can no longer use git checkout -. That'll put us back in the detached HEAD, since that was our previous location. We'll have to specify the branch with git checkout main. And we're back in the primary timeline.\nLet's remain here for the moment, and then talk about how to hang on to changes we're not ready to commit while moving between branches.\n"},"2_possibilities/2-2_hanging-onto-changes.html":{"url":"2_possibilities/2-2_hanging-onto-changes.html","title":"2-2: Hanging onto Changes","keywords":"","body":"2-2: Hanging Onto Changes\nLet's switch back over to our experiment branch. You can do so with either git switch or git checkout. I tend to use git checkout, but that's because I'm a thousand years old.\nAnyway, once we're there, let's add some content to experiment.txt\necho \"Work in progress\" >> experiment.txt\n\nNow of course git status shows we have unstaged changes.\n\nAlright well that's enough experimenting for today! Now back to work on the main branch.\ngit switch main\n\nWait, what?!\n\nYou can't leave with uncommitted changes! This is actually where git checkout makes sense as a metaphor. You can't leave the store with items you didn't pay for! Also, I love how the error message still says checkout, even when we use git switch.\nWe're told we have 2 options: commit our changes or \"stash\" them. Stash them where? Under the floorboards? In a shoebox under the bed?\nYeah so, it turns out that git saw this problem coming. You're working on something, you're not ready to commit, but you need to switch branches. What should you do? Git comes with a place to store work-in-progress changes before you commit them: the stash. \nThe Stash\ngit stash --help, as usual, gives more detail than is immediately useful without context, so let's start playing around. Try just:\ngit stash\n\nYou should see something like:\n\nIf you cat experiment.txt, you'll see that the new line has disappeared. But it's not gone forever; it's just in the stash! Let's bring it back.\ngit stash pop\n\nThe unique part of this status message is the Dropped refs... at the bottom. This is telling us that we just removed a reference from the stash and reapplied it to our working tree.\nLet's put the changes back in the stash, but this time, we'll do so with the push command. We'll also provide a custom message rather than the default \"WIP\" one Git makes for us.\ngit stash push -m \"Not finished with this experiment!\"\n\nBefore bringing our changes back again, let's run git stash list. This shows the existing changes in the stash. Yes, you can have more than one. To prove it, let's move back over to main and make some unstaged changes.\ngit checkout main\necho \"Putting the work in\" >> file2.txt\ngit stash push -m \"Working on main\"\n\nNow, try git stash list again.\n\nSee? We can have multiple changes stashed—even across branches! \nLet's head back over to experiment with git checkout -. How do we get the right stash entry back out?\ngit stash pop takes an optional --index argument that refers to the number inside the {} characters in git stash list. So:\ngit stash pop --index 1\n\nWill reapply the proper changes to our branch. Let's finish up here.\necho \"Done...for now\" >> experiment.txt\ngit commit -am \"Finish WIP experiment\"\n\nNow, we don't really need that other stashed change from main anymore. We can remove it from the stash with git stash drop. This command can also be used with an index number, similar to pop, if we have multiple stash entries.\nAnd that's it for hanging on to work in progress changes! Up next, we'll cover joining two branches together again.\nCheck For Understanding\nCreate a new branch. Then, make some unstaged changes. Stash them and switch back to main. Move back to your new branch and reapply the changes. Switch back to main again. Repeat until you can do this without looking up the commands!\n"},"2_possibilities/2-3_merges.html":{"url":"2_possibilities/2-3_merges.html","title":"2-3: Merges","keywords":"","body":"2-3: Merges\nThe time has come to bring our two branches together again. This usually occurs after a feature or fix has been completed and is ready to be introduced to a more primary branch. But how does git actually combine branches? This is a more complicated question than you might imagine, and in fact Git has multiple strategies it employs to merge branches, depending on the situation. But for now, we'll focus on the basics.\nThinking back to git diff and even the notices we see after commits, it's clear that Git can track files line-by-line. This linewise examination is how Git proceeds for plaintext files. When comparing two branches, it looks at each file with changes. If one branch has changes and the other does not, or if the changes are identical, the change is adopted. If both branches have a change at the same location and they do not match, then a merge conflict arises. We'll address conflict resolution a bit later.\nOur First Merge\nIf you run git merge --help, you get a lovely ASCII-art diagram of diverging branches being recombined:\n      A---B---C topic\n     /         \\\nD---E---F---G---H main\nAn important point in this diagram is commits F and G. Notice that commits can continue to take place on the main branch while the topic branch does its thing.\nLet's see if we can get that going with a couple of commits on main. Make sure you're on that branch before continuing.\ngit switch main\necho \"The work goes on\" >> file1.txt\ngit commit -am \"Continued main updates\"\necho \"And on and on and on\" >> file2.txt\ngit commit -am \"Even more main updates\"\n\nCool, we now have some parallel commits to our experiment branch. Now, we're ready for our first merge. The most basic version of the syntax is git merge , so:\ngit merge experiment\n\nSince this is a commit, your editor will pop up for a commit message. We could have provided a -m, but I wanted you to see that a merge does indeed create a commit.\n\nWe get quite a bit of info following the merge. First, we're told the merge was made using the ort strategy. That's the default strategy, but there are others. We also see a list of files changed/added—in this case, experiment.txt was added with 3 lines.\nGraphing Merges\nIn a world where commits can originate in multiple branches, it can be helpful to see where exactly a commit came from. There is a way to do this with git log.\nFirst, try git log --graph. You'll see something like this:\n\nI've highlighted the branch diagram, as well as the most recent commit on each branch which identifies the branch name. Although simplistic, this little diagram can tell us a lot about the history of our repo, and where a commit came from. But it is kind of a lot of text. Luckily, we can abbreviate it. \ngit log --graph --oneline\n\n\nMuch easier to read if you ask me.\ngit log has several additional options to help make the review process easier, like --limit, --since, and --until. Everyone has their preferences for how to use git log. Take some time to practice and find yours.\nSquashing\nFor the next bit, it's time once again for a new branch. Let's make the phase2 branch and switch two it. This time we'll use git switch instead of git checkout, with the -c option, to create a new branch.\ngit switch -c phase2\n\nNow, time for some commits! Here's a set of commands to quickly generate some commits.\ntouch phase2.txt\ngit add phase2.txt\ngit commit -m \"Add phase2.txt\"\nbash -c 'for i in $(seq 10); do echo \"Step $i\" >> phase2.txt; git commit -am \"Step $i\"; done'\n\nNow let's switch back to main.\nBut before we merge these commits, let's pause for a moment. Do we really need all those tiny commits in this merge? Do we need to preserve every single one? Or would it be enough to represent the work in phase2 as a single entity, and merge that. \nWe can do that with the --squash option. This will compress the many commits into change, apply it to the current working tree, but not execute the commit. You still need to review the changes first, and then you can make the commit.\ngit merge --squash phase2\n\n\nYou can see here that phase2.txt, all 10 lines of it, is added. However we're also told that as this is a \"squash commit,\" HEAD will not be updated. That's why my Git status indicator turns gold, indicating I have staged changes. git status will show I have a new file staged. From here, as long as I'm happy with the results of the merge, I'm ready to commit.\ngit commit -m \"Merge phase2\"\n\nNow, git log --graph --oneline will only show a single commit for all that effort. It won't even show a separate branch! This might be what you want, but it might not. Also note that if you switch over to the phase2 branch, the original commits are preserved in that branch's logs. You now have slightly different versions of history.\nPersonally, I don't like to squash commits unless it would be very messy (dozens of commits clogging up the log) to do otherwise. I prefer to be able to see exactly what got merged in my primary branch.\nAnd now that we're done with the phase2 branch, we can delete it.\ngit branch -D phase 2\n\nNow that's how merges work when everything's going well. Up next, we'll cover what happens when things go wrong.\n"},"2_possibilities/2-4_when-merges-go-wrong.html":{"url":"2_possibilities/2-4_when-merges-go-wrong.html","title":"2-4: When Merges Go Wrong","keywords":"","body":"2-4: When Merges Go Wrong\n\nTwo objects cannot occupy the same point in space and time, or so say Newtonian physics. While quantum reality may get a little fuzzier on those questions, Git commits do not. During a merge, commits that have different changes in the same file, on the same line results in merge conflicts.\nConflicts are uncommon, but also unavoidable when you have a large number of branches or developers for the same project. Sooner or later, somebody will make a change to a file in direct contradiction to somebody else's change.\nGit has a process for resolving these conflicts, but it takes getting used to. Let's get ourselves into some trouble!\ngit switch -c trouble\necho \"This line goes out to the rebels!\" >> file1.txt\necho \"This line goes out to the dreamers!\" >> file2.txt\ngit commit -am \"Who cares about main; I'm doing my own thing\"\ngit switch main\necho \"I'm definitely keeping this\" >> file1.txt\ngit commit -am \"Add line to file1 that I'm definitely keeping\"\ngit merge trouble\n\nAaaand conflict.\n\nUh oh. What have we done?!\nFirst, review git status to understand the current state of the working tree.\nConflict Syntax\n\nThere's quite a bit of information here. First, we're told the merge did not complete. If we want to back out entirely, we can! We can run git merge --abort, and we'll go back to our clean main, no harm no foul. But what about that change in file2.txt? What if we actually want that? We can't just ignore this problem; we need to confront it head-on. For the first time in this course, I'm going to ask you to use a text editor. Any editor will do, but use it to open file1.txt.\n\nWhat da—Git modified our file for us! Yeah, this is one of the more intrusive Git operations. When there's a conflict in a file, Git will add lines indicating where conflicting sections begin an end. This will always start with the  marker to indicate the current state. Beneath that are all the lines that are currently present in the branch you're on. Then comes ======= to show the branch separation. Then comes all the lines that differ, until the >>>>>>> and branch name. \nResolving Conflicts\nTo sort this mess out, you need to decide which lines stay and which lines go. This is a manual process. There are tools that can make it a little easier, and we'll discuss them later, but I want you to be comfortable with how Git presents its raw data. \nI think we want to keep the current branch's version, so let's delete not only the Git markings, but also the incoming line from trouble. The file should look like this when done:\nMy first commit!\nMy second commit!\nI wish I hadn't done this\nAh just kidding, I'm good with it\nThe work goes on\nI'm definitely keeping this\nSave and quit.\nWe now have to re-stage file1.txt and commit our changes to finish the merge.\ngit add file1.txt\ngit merge --continue\n\nWhen we do git merge --continue, you'll notice a text editor pops up. You can of course pass -m with a message to bypass this. But hey! Our working tree is clean again! \nRun git log --oneline --graph to see the fruits of your labor. Look at those pretty branches.\nAs always, there is a great deal more depth to the topic of conflict resolution, but this is where to start. You'll now have what you need to fix these issue when they arise.\nCheck For Understanding\nWhat happens if I make commits to the same file in 2 different branches, but on different lines? Maybe something to test...\n"},"2_possibilities/2-5_more-commit-sorcery.html":{"url":"2_possibilities/2-5_more-commit-sorcery.html","title":"2-5: More Commit Sorcery","keywords":"","body":"2-5: More Commit Sorcery\nBefore we finish with the unit on Git mechanics, I want to discuss two other invaluable ways of manipulating commits: cherry-pick and rebase.\nFor this exploration, let's begin by making two branches off of main.\ngit switch -c longterm\ngit switch -c shorttem\ngit switch main\n\nAnd back to main. The idea here is we have two separate efforts in our project: a long-term project that has multiple goals and features to add, running in parallel to main for some time; and a short-term project that has a single objective and will soon be merged back into main.\nCherry Picking\nBut what if one of these branches ends up doing something cool that another branch needs? For example, what if the people working on longterm fix an error that affects every other branch, but nobody's quite ready to merge longterm in yet? How can we get that particular fix without getting everything else?\nIf we've been disciplined with our commits, we can use git cherry-pick. This will take a single commit hash and apply it to the current working tree without any other changes before or after. Let's see it in action by making a bunch of commits in longterm.\ngit switch longterm\necho \"The start of something great\" > newfeature.txt\ngit add newfeature.txt\ngit commit -m \"Start new feature\"\necho \"Continued progress on new feature\" >> newfeature.txt\ngit commit -am \"More new feature work\"\nsed -i \"s/Step 1/Step 0\\nStep 1/m\" phase2.txt\ngit commit -am \"How did we forget Step 0?!\"\n\n\nIf you wanna know more about that sed command, you might like our Intro to Regular Expressions Course!\n\nSo, alongside the ongoing work on newfeature.txt, the folks working on longterm have fixed a problem in phase2.txt! How did we forget Step 0?! Ah well, problem solved. Of course, we aren't yet ready to merge this whole thing into main. Instead, we can use git cherry-pick to apply just this commit.\nFirst, grab the commit hash for the most recent commit:\ngit log --oneline -n 1\n\nThen, head over to main and pick that cherry!\ngit switch main\ngit cherry-pick \n\nYou'll see something like:\n\nLooking at the contents of the repo, you won't see newfeature.txt! But phase2.txt has Step 0 now! This is yet another reason why being very intentional with your commits pays dividends. You never know when you might have to pick one off the tree.\n\ngit cherry-pick can actually take as many commit hashes in order as you give it, but I would be very careful using it with more than one at at time.\n\nAll Your Rebase\nNow let's head over to shortterm and add some work.\ngit switch shortterm\ngit mv experiment.txt feature.txt\ngit commit -m \"Stabilizing experimental feature\"\necho \"Now working as intended\" >> feature.txt\ngit commit -am \"Stable feature\"\nThis branch is now behind main thanks to our cherry-picked commit. It is also ahead of main with the changes introduced here. \nAt this point, we need to learn a new git log trick. It turns out you can give git log multiple branch names, and it will include all commits reachable from all the listed branches. So git log main shortterm --oneline --graph results in:\n\nNote that the leftmost line is always our current branch, which is why main looks like a weird spar at the top there. \nAt this point, we have two options: we can merge main into shortterm, which will work fine, but may not be the story we want to tell, since we'll later be merging shortterm back to main. If we want shortterm to have its commits appear after the work in main, we have another option: git rebase will take our branch's commits and apply them after the new base, creating a single cohesive history. Try it!\ngit rebase main\n\nRerun git log main shortterm --oneline --graph. It looks different!\n\nNow shortterm actually includes the Step 0 fix without a merge. This can be a cleaner way to handle updating feature branches rather than constant multidirectional merging. But! if you want to represent the actual order of when commits took place, merges may be more appropriate.\nEnd of Unit 2\nNice job! You've made it through the most complex section of this course, covering basic Git mechanics. The topics in this Unit require practice to truly understand and internalize, and I encourage you to do so. Rebasing in particular tends to confuse people, so make sure to get comfortable with what happens during a rebase as opposed to a merge. Try explaining it in writing in your own words!\nThen, we'll move off a single system in the next Unit on collaborating with others!\n"},"3_collaborating/":{"url":"3_collaborating/","title":"3: Collaborating","keywords":"","body":"3: Collaborating\nThis Unit concerns how we use Git with others.\n"},"3_collaborating/3-1_remotes.html":{"url":"3_collaborating/3-1_remotes.html","title":"3-1: Remotes","keywords":"","body":"3-1: Remotes\nThis whole time, we've been pretending to be working with a team on different features and branches in our project. But in reality, doing so means coordinating respositories across multiple computers. And while we haven't yet done so with our exploration of Git, this was absolutely its design intention. This where remotes come in.\nRemotes\nAll the way back at the beginning of the course, I asked you to fork this repo on GitHub and then clone your copy of the repo. And then we never mentioned those two operations again. Now I'd like you to navigate to that folder on your computer in your terminal, and run the following command:\ncat .git/config\n\nNow head over to our gitdemo repo that we've been working on this whole time. Run the same command. See any differences?\nThe cloned repo has several sections not present in gitdemo. For starters, a [remote \"origin\"] that seems to indicate where the repo came from in the first place. \nRemotes are copies of the repository on another computer. Often, this is on a Git hosting service like GitHub (there are others, btw). Git will connect to this remote copy of the repo and pull new changes present there but missing locally, and push new changes that are local but yet to be sent to the remote. \nWhen working with a team, usually a single remote is defined as the single source of truth for a project, and commits to the remote's main branch are carefully managed. Different hosting services offer different mechanisms for reviewing and approving changes, which we'll talk about shortly.\nBut first, we need to discuss a little more about how remotes work with our local repo. To make this clearer, run git branch -a in your fork of this course repo.\nThe -a option shows all branches, not just locals. With this option, you see remotes/origin entries as well. origin is Git's name for the default remote, and is assigned to a source repo when we clone it.\nYou can have more than one remote, for example a backup, or an upstream version of the project. But most repos hosted remotely have just the one.\nGit Hosts\nSpeaking of hosts, while GitHub is by far the most well-known, there are several other choices for Git Hosting! Here are few to check out:\n\nBitbucket\nGitLab\nCodeberg\nOr self-host with Gitea!\n\nRemotes In Action\nWe've seen git clone do its thing, but there's actually quite a bit going on under the hood. To demonstrate, we're going to add a remote to gitdemo manually. To do this, you'll need a GitHub account, but you already have one of those!\nWhile logged in, head to https://github.com/new. We're making a new repo on GitHub. Call it gitdemo. You can make it private if you like. Don't bother adding a README or anything else. Your options should look something like this:\n\nCreate that thing! GitHub will then helpfully give you some pointers on how to connect a local repo to it. But don't jump ahead; we're doing it step-by-step.\nStep 1: Add a Remote\nGet your Terminal into the gitdemo folder. Here's where we add a remote manually.\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/gitdemo.git\n\nWe've already created a main branch, so we're all set there.\nIf you cat .git/config now, you'll see a remote set up!\nStep 2: Connect Local main to origin/main\nRight now, Git doesn't know that your local main has anything to do with main on GitHub. Well in fact, right now GitHub's main doesn't exist. Let's fix that. \ngit push -u origin main\n\nAnd there's git push! This does 2 things: it creates a main branch on GitHub by uploading our local commits; and it sets up our local main to track the new main on GitHub. You can confirm this by examining .git/config. There's now a new [branch \"main\"] section that points to origin as its remote.\nNow that we have a remote, let's demonstrate merging changes from it to our local copy—also known as a pull.\nMaking Remote Changes\nLuckily, GitHub is making a very helpful suggestion for us in terms of remote changes: adding a README!\n\nLet's do it! Click that button. You'll be taken to GitHub's built-in editor for our new file. It's fine as-is; just hit that big green \"Commit changes...\" button.\n\nAnd click through again for the default commit message.\nHey, now there's a README.md on the GitHub version of main. But our local is missing it.\nFetching Remote Changes\nYou might be thinking the solution is git pull, and you're right, but slow down! git pull, much like git clone, is actually multiple Git commands disguised in a trenchcoat.\nFirst, let's run git status to see how things stand.\n\nNow that we have a remote, git status provides new information. But we know it's wrong! Our branch is not uo to date with GitHub! What's up?\nThis is important: Git does not fetch remote changes automatically. But we can. Do so with git fetch. Now run git status again.\n\nAha! Now it knows.\nWhile it tells us we can run git pull, here's a secret: git pull is git fetch + git merge . \nSo at this point, if you run git merge origin/main, you'll perform exactly what git pull would have done.\n\nNobody actually does this; git pull is way more convenient. But I wanted you to understand what was happening underneath. Because Git maintains a local copy of the remote branch, it's available for merging after a fetch. Pulling is just a combination of those two operations. \nOkay, that'll do it for remotes. Up next, we'll talk about how to handle multiple remote branches and merging changes to main.\nCheck For Understanding\nIf pull is a combination of fetch and merge, what happens on the remote during git push?\n"},"3_collaborating/3-2_pull-requests.html":{"url":"3_collaborating/3-2_pull-requests.html","title":"3-2: Pull Requests","keywords":"","body":"3-2: Pull Requests\nOur project is up and running on GitHub, whoo! We're now able to collaborate with our team members across the world, keeping our locals updated with the latest changes in the authoritative source.\nBut imagine this situation: you and a colleague are both working on the same file. They push a change to main that is in direct contradiction to what you're doing. Then you go to pull. Suddenly, a merge conflict through no fault of your own!\nOr even worse, you push your changes to main and suddenly now the official repo has a merge conflict. This is no way to manage changes.\nEnter Pull Requests. These are a mechanism in GitHub and other repo hosting services to handle merges with review, discussion, and accountability. Here's the basic process:\n\nA contributor makes a push to a remote branch other than the merge target. The merge target can be main, but doesn't have to be.\nA pull request is opened, proposing a merge from the branch that just got pushed to the target branch.\nAt this point, the repo hosting service will do a few things: perform a preflight on the merge to see if there are conflicts; open a discussion thread about the merge; and launch any automated tasks that have been configured by the team.\nAfter the merge has been approved, the merge is committed to the target branch. The reviewers then have the option to close the merged branch.\n\nIt makes more sense in practice. Let's request a pull!\nPull Request Example\nDon't worry; you don't need to find a friend for this next part. You can play the role of multiple contributors for the purposes of this lesson.\nLet's start back in gitdemo by creating a new branch for our \"colleague.\"\ngit switch -c colleague\n\nTime to make a new change!\necho \"New work from a new teammate\" >> file1.txt\ngit commit -am \"New work on file1\"\n\nNow we need to push this to GitHub. Just like before, there is no colleague branch there yet, so we need to add it with the -u option for git push.\ngit push -u origin colleague\n\n\nOh hey look at that; GitHub is telling us right in the terminal that we can open a pull request. Good idea, GitHub! Follow that link or head to your repo on GitHub.\nIf you go soon after the push, you'll see a notification on the repo's main page about the push, with a handy link to make the PR. Do it!\n\nOtherwise, head to \"Pull Requests\" and click the \"New Pull Request\" button.\n\nWhen using the prompts, the new PR form is pre-filled out for you. Opening a PR manually means you need to set up the base and target branches. Our base in this case is main, compared with colleague.\n\nGitHub should tell us that everything looks good and we can create the PR. Do so now.\nPR Process\nAt this point, agreed-upon procedures for change management take over. Some can be automated, but others will be matters of policy. Discussion about big changes should take place in the thread opened for the PR, until all principals agree to the change. \nIn this case, it's a committee of one, so let's go ahead and merge.\n\nOnce done, you can delete the colleague branch on GitHub.\nNow back in the terminal, let's switch to main and get our new changes.\ngit switch main\ngit pull\n\nAnd now the new changes are in our main local branch! A review of git log --oneline --graph shows the PR represented in both the remote and local colleague branches.\n\nThat's it for the mechanics of PRs, but the practice can get a little more complicated. This next section is a bit of wisdom I've picked up along the way about how to do PRs well. \nPR Best Practices\nBranch Strategies\nGenerally speaking, branches are either long-term or short-term. Long-term branches can be for specific versions, development efforts, or even for the ongoing work of specific teams. PRs can be opened from invididual devs to the team branch, or to those specific version branches.\nShort-term branches are useful for specific features or bugfixes. PRs can be opened from them to the appropriate long-term branches.\nPR Approvals\nIn my experience, it's best if one or a very small group of people have final say on PR approvals per branch. You want to strike a balance between discussion, accountability, and a timely decision process. The bigger the change, the more important discussion around the change impacts will be.\nAutomated Processes\nAlthough outside the scope of this course, I encourage you to explore automated processes that would be appropriate for your project. That could mean automated builds or testing such that your tools are doing all possible checks to make sure the changes won't break anything. Then, automated deployment can get your changes published as quickly as possible. This is known as Continuous Integration/Continuous Development, or CI/CD. \nGit Tags and Releases\nOne last Git trick before we get out of here: Git has a built-in tool for version management: tags!\nTags are metadata we can add to commits to indicate versioning. These tags are reviewable in GitHub and can be attached to Releases, to indicate significant updates available for users.\nVersioning\nThere are many version numbering strategies, but I tend to subscribe to SemVer, or Semantic Versioning. The details can be negotiable, but big picture we have 3 parts to the version number, like 1.2.3. \nMaking a Tag and Release\nLet's tag a version and release it!\nWe start on main and create a tag. This is a pre-release version, so we'll do 0.1.0.\ngit tag -a 0.1.0 -m \"Initial release\"\n\nThis adds (-a) with a message (-m) of \"Initial release.\"\nNow, to send this tag to GitHub, there is a specific push syntax:\ngit pugh origin 0.1.0\n\nAnd just like that, we have a new tag available! You can see this in the bottom right of the repo main page, or at /tags.\n\nyy\nTo make a release, click on the \"Releases\" tab, and \"Create a new release.\"\n\nOn the next form, you can choose an existing tag or make a new one. Good thing we know how to make tags now! You can then add details about the release, as well as upload any files you want users to be able to download (like compiled binaries).\nOnce done, we have ourselves a release!\nI tend to only add tags and create releases from main to keep things clean. Other branches eventually feed into that branch for new versions, but other projects can take advantage of other structures.\nAnd that's it for PRs! Moving into the final Unit, we'll discuss publishing documentation using GitHub and Honkit—kinda what we've been building to this whole time!\n"},"4_publishing/":{"url":"4_publishing/","title":"4: Publishing","keywords":"","body":"4: Publishing\nHere we discuss using Git and GitHub to publish our project directly.

Thank you for your service, gitdemo, but where we're going, you can't follow.\nThis Unit is the reason you forked the creating-with-git repo lo those many Units ago. This is where we start to build something legitimately useful: a documentation site.\nGit and Documentation\nWhile Git is most famous for work with projects made of programming languages, we've demonstrated in this course that it is just as capable at managing projects of human language—provided the files are plaintext. That's why we mentioned Markdown back at the beginning.\nIt also happens to be how this site is built! Every page you see rendered here is the result of a Markdown file being processed by the Honkit tool into a static HTML page, which we can serve a number of different ways.\nGit serves as a powerful tool for managing documentation—and not just for software projects. All too often, important institutional knowledge lies withering in some old Wiki, or in knowledge systems (cough Confluence cough) that nobody uses because nobody likes the interface. These entropic knowledgebases are dangerous to organizations. Instead, I recommend a tool that is lightweight, flexible, and has stood the test of time.\nFor input data, that's plaintext in the form of plaintext (Markdown). For management, Git fits that bill nicely. And for output, nothing makes more sense than HTML. With decades under their belt, you can rely on the knowledge stored in Git repos to be available and updateable for years to come.\nGitHub has a Wiki option for Pro accounts, but no: we're talking about how to make knowledge accessible and transferable. We can't rely on any single platform's features. Instead, we're going to use the open source Honkit to convert a repo of Markdown files—y'know, like this one—into a searachable website of documentation. Y'know, like this one.\n😮\nThat's right: all along, this site and the repo it's based on has been a secret template for your own documentation project. \nRepo Preparation\nEverything we do from here on out should take place in your fork of creating-with-git.\nIn the next lesson, we're going to deploy our docs site! If you followed the instructions in the Introduction, you already have Node and Honkit working—in fact, you may be reading this site on the local version of the docs. If not, head back to that page and make sure to run the commands listed there to install Node and Honkit.\nIn the next chapter, we're going to use GitHub's Pages feature to publish our docs as a static site. This will mean you need to shut down npx honkit serve if you're running it from your local fork. You're more than welcome to keep running it from the Taggart Institute copy of the repo, or referring to the docs at cwg.taggartinstitute.org.\nSee you there!\n"},"4_publishing/4-2_github-pages.html":{"url":"4_publishing/4-2_github-pages.html","title":"4-2: GitHub Pages","keywords":"","body":"4-2: GitHub Pages\nThe Honkit tool that we're using can generate websites for any platform, but since we're on GitHub anyhow, we can take advantage of GitHub Pages. This feature lets you host static websites directly from a GitHub Repo. There are technically two ways to use this feature. You can see this in your repo's Pages settings (/settings/pages)\n\nThere are 2 ways to use GitHub Pages: either through GitHub Actions, or by specifying a branch that will contain the contents for the site. That being said, I greatly prefer using GitHub Actions for the automated build process. Once you're comfortable with Pages, I would check out Actions.\nWe're going to use the branch method, as GitHub Actions are a little outside the scope of this course.\nBranch Setup\nIn your local copy of your creating-with-git fork, make a new branch for our Pages deployment.\ngit switch -c pages\n\nThen, as we've done before, push this new branch to GitHub.\ngit push -u origin pages\n\nNow we're not quite finished. See, this branch is going to include some parts that main does not. This branch needs to have the contents of the built site. So, y'know, let's build the site.\nnpx honkit build\n\nYou'll notice that there is _book folder in your repo. That's where your built site is! This folder has actually been there for a while now, since that's where npx honkit serve was generating our local site. But Git was ignoring it based on an entry in the repo's .gitignore file.\nNow unfortunately, GitHub Pages is a bit inflexible in this regard. If you want to use a branch and not the root of the repo, the folder name has to be docs. We can make this change in once, but we want to make sure this process is repeatable. \nIt's time to write a build script.\n\nBtw, this is the exact kind of nonsense that GitHub Actions is designed to automate. Still, I think it's worthwhile to learn the manual process first.\n\nBuild Script\nOur build script needs to accomplish the following:\n\nMake the docs folder if it doesn't exist.\nRebuild the site.\nCopy the _book folder contents to docs\nCreate a new commit for the rebuild (every time), maybe with a date?\nPush the commit to GitHub.\n\nHonestly not too bad, and easily done in bash. Here's what our new build.sh should look like.\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Make docs folder if it doesn't exist\nif [ ! -d docs ]; then\n    mkdir docs\nfi\n\n# Rebuild the site\nnpx honkit build\n\n# Copy the `_book` folder contents to `docs`\ncp -Rf _book/* docs/\n\n# Create a new commit for the rebuild (every time), maybe with a date?\ngit add docs/\ngit commit -m \"Rebuild: $(date)\"\n\n# Push the commit to GitHub.\ngit push\n\nSave this file. Then make it executable by running chmod +x build.sh. Let's do a test run! Make some changes to your Markdown files, then run:\n./build.sh\n\nIf all goes well, your content should be pushed to GitHub, and in a minute or two, your site will be live at https://your-account-name.github.io/your-repo-name.\nBelieve it or not, that's it! You've not only published your documentation, but you've finished this course! Well done!
