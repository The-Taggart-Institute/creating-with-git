# 2-2: Hanging Onto Changes

Let's switch back over to our `experiment` branch. You can do so with either `git switch` or `git checkout`. I tend to use `git checkout`, but that's because I'm a thousand years old.

Anyway, once we're there, let's add some content to `experiment.txt`

```bash
echo "Work in progress" >> experiment.txt
```

Now of course `git status` shows we have unstaged changes.

Alright well that's enough experimenting for today! Now back to work on the `main` branch.

```bash
git switch main
```

Wait, what?!

You can't leave with uncommitted changes! This is actually where `git checkout` makes sense as a metaphor. You can't leave the store with items you didn't pay for! Also, I love how the error message still says `checkout`, even when we use `git switch`.

We're told we have 2 options: commit our changes or "stash" them. Stash them where? Under the floorboards? In a shoebox under the bed?

Yeah so, it turns out that `git` saw this problem coming. You're working on something, you're not ready to commit, but you need to switch branches. What should you do? Git comes with a place to store work-in-progress changes before you commit them: the stash. 

## The Stash

`git stash --help`, as usual, gives more detail than is immediately useful without context, so let's start playing around. Try just:

```bash
git stash
```

You should see something like:

![git stash 1](/img/git-stash-1.png)

If you `cat experiment.txt`, you'll see that the new line has disappeared. But it's not gone forever; it's just in the stash! Let's bring it back.

```bash
git stash pop
```

The unique part of this status message is the `Dropped refs...` at the bottom. This is telling us that we just removed a reference from the stash and reapplied it to our working tree.

Let's put the changes back in the stash, but this time, we'll do so with the `push` command. We'll also provide a custom message rather than the default "WIP" one Git makes for us.

```bash
git stash push -m "Not finished with this experiment!"
```

Before bringing our changes back again, let's run `git stash list`. This shows the existing changes in the stash. Yes, you can have more than one. To prove it, let's move back over to `main` and make some unstaged changes.

```bash
git checkout main
echo "Putting the work in" >> file2.txt
git stash push -m "Working on main"
```

Now, try `git stash list` again.

![git stash 3](/img/git-stash-3.png)

See? We can have multiple changes stashedâ€”even across branches! 

Let's head back over to experiment with `git checkout -`. How do we get the right stash entry back out?

`git stash pop` takes an optional `--index` argument that refers to the number inside the `{}` characters in `git stash list`. So:

```bash
git stash pop --index 1
```

Will reapply the proper changes to our branch. Let's finish up here.

```bash
echo "Done...for now" >> experiment.txt
git commit -am "Finish WIP experiment"
```

Now, we don't really need that other stashed change from `main` anymore. We can remove it from the stash with `git stash drop`. This command can also be used with an index number, similar to `pop`, if we have multiple stash entries.

And that's it for hanging on to work in progress changes! Up next, we'll cover joining two branches together again.


## Check For Understanding

**Create a new branch. Then, make some unstaged changes. Stash them and switch back to `main`. Move back to your new branch and reapply the changes. Switch back to `main` again. Repeat until you can do this without looking up the commands!**
