# 4-2: GitHub Pages

The Honkit tool that we're using can generate websites for any platform, but since we're on GitHub anyhow, we can take advantage of [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). This feature lets you host static websites directly from a GitHub Repo. There are technically two ways to use this feature. You can see this in your repo's Pages settings (`/settings/pages`)

There are 2 ways to use GitHub Pages: either through GitHub Actions, or by specifying a branch that will contain the contents for the site. That being said, I _greatly prefer_ using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for the automated build process. Once you're comfortable with Pages, I would check out Actions.

We're going to use the branch method, as GitHub Actions are a little outside the scope of this course.

## Branch Setup

In your local copy of your `creating-with-git` fork, make a new branch for our Pages deployment.

```bash
git switch -c pages
```

Then, as we've done before, push this new branch to GitHub.

```bash
git push -u origin pages
```

Now we're not quite finished. See, this branch is going to include some parts that `main` does not. This branch needs to have the contents of the built site. So, y'know, let's build the site.


```bash
npx honkit build
```

You'll notice that there is `_book` folder in your repo. That's where your built site is! This folder has actually been there for a while now, since that's where `npx honkit serve` was generating our local site. But Git was ignoring it based on an entry in the repo's `.gitignore` file.

Now unfortunately, GitHub Pages is a bit inflexible in this regard. If you want to use a branch and _not_ the root of the repo, the folder name has to be `docs`. We can make this change in once, but we want to make sure this process is repeatable. 

It's time to write a **build script**.

> Btw, this is the exact kind of nonsense that GitHub Actions is designed to automate. Still, I think it's worthwhile to learn the manual process first.

## Build Script

Our build script needs to accomplish the following:

1. Remove `docs` fodler if it exists to prevent it from getting added to `_book`.
2. Rebuild the site.
3. Copy the `_book` folder contents to `docs`
4. Create a new commit for the rebuild (every time), maybe with a date?
5. Push the commit to GitHub.

Honestly not too bad, and easily done in bash. Here's what our new `build.sh` should look like.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Remove existing docs folder 
if [ -d docs ]; then
    rm -rf docs
fi

# Rebuild the site
npx honkit build

# Copy the `_book` folder contents to `docs`
cp -Rf _book docs

# Create a new commit for the rebuild (every time), maybe with a date?
git add docs/
git commit -m "Rebuild: $(date)"

# Push the commit to GitHub.
git push

```

Save this file. Then make it executable by running `chmod +x build.sh`. Now of course we'll add it:

```bash
git add build.sh
git commit -m "Add build script"
```

Let's do a test run! Make some changes to your Markdown files, then run:

```bash
./build.sh
```

If all goes well, your content should be pushed to GitHub, and in a minute or two, your site will be live at `https://your-account-name.github.io/your-repo-name`.

Believe it or not, that's it! You've not only published your documentation, but you've finished this course! Well done! Now all that's left is the Exhibition Of Mastery.
